Bug reports
-----------

When `reporting a bug <https://github.com/CSIRO-Precision-Agriculture/pyprecag/issues>`_ please include:

    * Your operating system name and version.
    * Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
    * The pyprecag package version.
    * Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

Documentation improvements
--------------------------

pyprecag could always use more documentation, whether as part of the official pyprecag docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts, articles, and such.

.. note:: This project uses Google-style docstrings.
   Contributed code should follow the same conventions.
   For examples, please see the `Napoleon examples
   <http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.org/en/latest/example_google.html>`_,
   or the `Google Python Style Guide
   <https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md>`_.


Feature requests and feedback
-----------------------------

The best way to send feedback is to `file an issue <https://github.com/CSIRO-Precision-Agriculture/pyprecag/issues>`_

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are welcome :)

Or, implement the feature yourself and submit a pull request.
